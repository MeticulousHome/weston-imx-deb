weston (0.85.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial release (Closes: #630809).
  * Build without setuid for weston; it's very young and experimental, so
    let's be cautious.
  * Document weston's setuid bit (or lack thereof) in README.Debian.
  * Tiny/toy clients will be shipped in a later upload.
  * Restrict to linux-any since wayland isn't as portable as X.
  * Make sure the following packages are at least at 8.0-2 in the
    generated dependencies: libegl1-mesa, libegl1-mesa-drivers, and
    libgles2-mesa.
